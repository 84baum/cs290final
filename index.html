    <p>toneBox is a community supported site dedicated to the study of the sonic aging of musical instruments.
    Our passion is music and the development of tools to understand the process of musical
    instrument maturation and the tone we all associate with fine vintage instruments.</p>
    <p>We decided to develop this site to allow not just makers of instruments, but owners as
    well, to archive and study the tonal aging of their instruments. We do this by maintaining
    user uploaded sound files and providing proprietary graphing and comparison tools that 
    allow the user to track frequency response changes over time, overtone and fundamental decay
    and note balance.</p>
    <p>Through this collaboration between instrument makers and consumers over time we hope 
    to develop a knowledge base that will lead to a refinement of design choices my makers
    and an educated consumer base.</p> 
    <p>Currently we are using SoundCloud to embed audio tracks for our users. If have not already
    please go <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com" target="_blank">here</a> to create an account and follow the directions
    to embed audio clips</p>
